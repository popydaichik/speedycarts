# Speedy Carts


Speedy Carts is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.16.5 that increases the maximum speed of all minecarts by 15×. Place a minecart on a rail and watch it zoom!

- Reduces air drag for faster sustained speed.
- Applies the speed boost only once per cart to prevent exponential velocity growth.
